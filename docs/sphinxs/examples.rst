Examples
==========

The BDC-ODC project seeks to integrate Brazil Data Cube's data products and the Open Data Cube ecosystem of tools and services. Several tools are already being integrated, allowing BDC data to be consumed with the ODC.

As a way to present to BDC users how data products can be consumed with the ODC, several examples have been created, all publicly available. The examples are available in the `BDC-ODC repository <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/bdc-odc>`_.

.. note::

    Some examples available in the repository can only be executed together with the `utils package <https://github.com/opendatacube/datacube-notebooks>`_ provided by the ODC developers. This package has several features that facilitate the use of data cubes with Jupyter Notebooks.
